FumbleLog is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `fumblelog.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FumbleLog.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the fumblelog.jar file in, and use the `java -jar fumblelog.jar`
   command to run the application. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.<br>
   Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type commands into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all persons.

   * `add n/John Doe` : Adds a person named `John Doe` to the FumbleLog persons list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current persons list.

   * `exit` : Exits the FumbleLog.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for more details of FumbleLog's command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[g/GROUP]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `g/friend`, `g/friend g/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

# How we manage your data

### Saving the data

FumbleLog data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

FumbleLog data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FumbleLog will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FumbleLog home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
